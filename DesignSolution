Problem Statement:
Design A Google Analytic like Backend System. We need to provide Google Analytic like services to our customers. 

Technical Architecture:
1) Platform:
We can use Gaia Cloud hosting instead of physical servers.It has several advantages
-->A suitable environment to run an application.
-->Application life cycle management.
-->Self-healing capacity.
-->Centralized management of applications.
-->Distributed environment.
-->Easy integration.

2) Front End Architecture:
To have a good look and feel for the application, we can use the below technologies to create the screens/front-end .
a) react js
b) angular js

3) Backend Architecture:
a) Technology Stack:
If we want to go with JAVA based approach, it is better to use the below technologies.
i)  Spring Boot - easy to develop Spring-based applications with Java and can test web applications easily.
ii) Spring JPA - just need to define methods and can write queries using @Query, no need to write complete implementation/code.

b) Database Architecture:
i) Cassandra database- to write large volumes of data and faster search. we can easily integrate it with the above techonologies.

5)Authentication:
We can provide user authentication using oauth or ADFS based authentication.

6)Security:
